### AI Terminologies

1. **Artificial Intelligence:** AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. It encompasses various techniques like machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics.

2. **Intelligent Agent:** An intelligent agent is an autonomous entity that observes and acts upon an environment to achieve specific goals. It uses sensors to perceive its environment and actuators to perform actions.

3. **AI Winter:** AI Winter refers to periods of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research due to unmet expectations and slow progress. These periods typically result from disillusionment after high initial hopes.

4. **Back-propagation Algorithm:** The back-propagation algorithm is a supervised learning technique used for training artificial neural networks. It involves adjusting the weights of the network to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs.

5. **Search Strategies Example (Informed and Uninformed):** Informed search strategies use additional information to find solutions more efficiently, such as the A* algorithm. Uninformed search strategies, like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), rely only on the problem definition without extra information.

6. **A* Algorithm Peculiarity:** The A* algorithm is peculiar because it combines the advantages of both uniform-cost search and pure heuristic search, ensuring optimal and complete solutions. It uses a cost function, f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the cost from the start to node n, and h(n) is the heuristic estimated cost from n to the goal.

7. **Expert System:** An expert system is an AI program that simulates the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization with expert knowledge in a specific domain. It uses a knowledge base and inference engine to solve complex problems.

8. **Fitness Function of a Problem:** The fitness function evaluates how close a given solution is to the optimal solution of a problem. It is widely used in optimization and genetic algorithms.

9. **Knowledge-base:** A knowledge-base is a repository of information and facts used by AI systems to make decisions and solve problems. It stores data, rules, and relationships relevant to the specific domain of the AI application.

10. **Predicate Logic:** Predicate logic is a formal system in mathematical logic that uses quantifiers and variables to express statements over objects. It extends propositional logic by dealing with predicates and quantification.

11. **Significance of Prolog and LISP:** Prolog is significant in AI for its use in logical programming and symbolic reasoning, particularly in natural language processing and theorem proving. LISP is important for its powerful symbolic expression capabilities and is commonly used in AI research and development.

12. **Propositional Logic:** Propositional logic is a branch of logic dealing with propositions that can be true or false. It uses logical connectives like AND, OR, NOT to build complex expressions from simpler ones.

13. **Tautology - Logic:** A tautology is a formula in logic that is true in every possible interpretation. It is a statement that cannot be false regardless of the truth values of its components.

14. **Uncertainty:** In AI, uncertainty refers to situations where the system does not have complete information about the environment or future states. Handling uncertainty is crucial for making robust decisions in dynamic and unpredictable environments.

15. **The Wumpus World Problem in AI:** The Wumpus World is a classic AI problem used to illustrate intelligent agent design, where an agent must navigate a grid world with hazards to find gold. It involves dealing with incomplete information and making inferences based on perceptions.

16. **How Cognitive Science is Different from Neuroscience:** Cognitive science studies the mind and its processes, focusing on how information is processed and used. Neuroscience, on the other hand, studies the biological and physiological aspects of the brain and nervous system.

17. **Why DFS is More Suitable than BFS for Solving Complex Problems:** DFS is often more suitable for problems with deep solutions and limited memory as it explores one branch deeply before backtracking. BFS, while ensuring the shortest path, can be memory-intensive for large search spaces.

18. **How the Complexity of Any Algorithms Can Be Evaluated:** The complexity of algorithms is evaluated using Big O notation, which describes the upper limit of the algorithm's runtime or space requirements in relation to the input size. It provides a way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.

19. **Turing Test Suitability for Measuring AI:** The Turing Test assesses a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human. While it remains a significant milestone, it does not fully measure all aspects of intelligence such as understanding and consciousness.

20. **Importance of Knowledge Representation in AI:** Knowledge representation is crucial in AI as it enables machines to interpret, reason, and make decisions based on the information they possess. It facilitates understanding and manipulation of complex data structures.

21. **Inference from Premises in AI:** Inference allows AI systems to derive new knowledge and make decisions based on existing information and logical rules. It is fundamental for reasoning and problem-solving in intelligent systems.

22. **Examples of Autonomous Machines:** Examples of autonomous machines include self-driving cars, robotic vacuum cleaners, and drones. Self-driving cars, for instance, navigate and operate independently by using sensors and AI algorithms.

23. **AI Behavior with Limited Knowledge:** When an AI machine has limited knowledge, it relies on pre-defined rules, heuristics, or learning from new data to make the next immediate action. This can lead to suboptimal decisions compared to having complete knowledge.

24. **Rationality in AI Models:** Rationality ensures that AI models make decisions that are logically sound and optimal given their goals and available information. It is essential for creating reliable and effective AI systems.

25. **Necessity of Machine Learning in AI Systems:** Machine learning allows AI systems to improve their performance over time by learning from data and experience. It is essential for handling complex, dynamic environments and making predictions.

26. **Fuzzy Logic vs. Traditional Prediction Models:** Fuzzy logic deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact, handling uncertainty and imprecision. Traditional prediction models usually rely on binary true/false values and may not handle ambiguity as effectively.

27. **Inspiration for Neural Network Models:** Neural network models are inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain, consisting of interconnected neurons that process information in parallel. They mimic the brain's ability to learn and recognize patterns.

28. **Three Expert Systems:** Examples include MYCIN (medical diagnosis), DENDRAL (chemical analysis), and CLIPS (production rule-based system). MYCIN, for instance, diagnoses bacterial infections and recommends antibiotics based on patient data and expert knowledge.

29. **Cybernetics in AI:** Cybernetics studies the structure, constraints, and possibilities of regulatory systems, including both mechanical and biological. It is crucial in AI for developing systems that can self-regulate, adapt, and learn from feedback.

30. **Future AI Machines:** Examples include autonomous surgical robots, intelligent personal assistants, and advanced predictive maintenance systems. Autonomous surgical robots could perform precise surgeries with minimal human intervention, improving outcomes and reducing recovery times.
